## About me

- 👋 I am Ji Liu, a roboticist with an unexpected background in training small rodents 🐹 (I actually got a PhD for that). Currently a master's student in robotics at the University of Maryland, I feel passionate about bringing more intelligent robots 🤖 to the world, so we can get to where we want to be faster, literally and figuratively. 

- 👩🏻‍💻 The topics in robotics I am excited about include ***autonomous robots***, ***control***, ***motion planning***, ***SLAM***, ***reinforcement learning***, etc. In this repo, you can find some of my coursework and personal projects that touch upon various aspects of these topics. I love learning new methods and concepts in robotics and am constantly pushing my technical boundaries.
  
-  🌱 I’m currently learning SLAM on my own and check out my latest [project](https://github.com/liuji1031/slam_ekf_ros2).

- 🎨 Aside from these, my other interests include 3D modeling/sculpting (I know some Blender and Zbrush), audiobooks, etc. One of my favorite reads is ***Creativity Inc.*** by Ed Catmull and Amy Wallace, which talks not only just about technical creativity but also about creative methods in managing people in an organization.
